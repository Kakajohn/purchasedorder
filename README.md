# Purchased Orders

### About the project implemantation - structure

The data are fetched into **App.js**. For better performance a fallback functionality is created. So in case something goes wrong with
the API URL the *catch* will trigger the function to call the *local json* file that has the same data as the API. In any case the function will
give us as response the data we need.

If you want to see the fallback try to remove something from the URL and you will still be able to see
the perspective data response on screen.

Into components folder we have **layout** and **orders** folders.

The Layout is the componenet that displays the final info of the project. Also while the project loads, a spinner shows up
on the users screen informing them about the data loading.

On the orders folders we have 4 components. Into OrdersList we pass as props the mapped data of the API. After that a list is created, that its size depends on
the data loading (in our case the list has 3 items).

As default for the project we create a table and set all its contents to false. So anytime a list item is selected only that item becomes 
true. After the user clicks the list item and the button's value becomes true the modal displays on fullscreen on the same page. By clicking the
**X** icon or by pressing escape the value returns to false and the modal closes.

Into OrdersListItem we set the button selected as active for the modal with the perspective data to show up on the screen.

Into OrderPreview Component we pass as props the info for the specific item with id to show up on the screen.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
